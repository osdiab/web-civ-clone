# Concept

A turn-based RTS with a focus on:

* Not too long game times
* Actions of most units are influenced, but not controlled by, the player, reducing the amount of action you have to take and pushing you into the meta-game.
* A focus on the costs of reskilling your population
* A focus on the cost of destroying the environment, **Future**: emphasized further in later stages of the game

## Map

The map is a generated tessellation of hexagonal tiles forming a cylinder, like in Civilization V, VI. Each tile has a type:

* Land
	* **Grassland**: Can be farmed
	* **Hills**: Can be farmed once terrace farms are researched, but otherwise impede movement
	* **Mountain**: Impassable.
	* **Desert**: Unfarmable. **Future**: If the atmosphere heats too much, Grassland and Hills can turn into deserts.
* Water
	* **Shallow water**: Must have basic sailing tech to pass. Contains fish, which contributes to food alongside farms.
	* **Deep water**: Must build larger ships to pass. Contains larger fish yields than shallow water.

Further, each tile can have modifiers:

* **Forest**: Has lumber. Impedes movement. **Future**: slows down rate of warming
* **Stone**: Has stone. Typically occurs on hills.
* **Iron**: Has iron. Typically occurs on hills.
* **Rainforest**: Impassable, but loggable. **Future**: slows down rate of warming
* **Frigid**: Unfarmable. Frigid water is ice, and is impassable. **Future**: heating the atmosphere can make these defrost.

**Future**: Other strategic and luxury resources like **coal**, **oil**, **gold**, **spices**, etc.

## Units

All units are civilians. By default, civilians are not controlled directly. They do what they want. But you can incentivize them to take different professions by increasing or decreasing wages for those lines of work. If they choose to become warriors, you can take direct control of them.

## Primary Resources

Buildings and units require some set of resources to build or upgrade, amongst the following:

* **Wood**
* **Stone**
* **Metal**
* **Food**

**Civilians** can be specialized into harvesting each of these items. A maximum number of `n_tileMaximum` civilians can work a tile, which can be enhanced by specific buildings (like a sawmill near a forest tile).

Separately, any deficit in the above items can be compensated with **money** via trade (see the Trade section below). Each civilian additionally requires being paid a wage, depending on their specialization.

Each item has certain peculiarities related to their harvest:

### Wood

Forest tiles have a **maximum capacity** and a **regeneration rate**. As you log a forest, you pull wood from its pile, and eventually a forest will be fully logged. Once it is fully logged, it turns into a grassland tile. You can replant grassland to become forests, but it takes a long time for them to regrow.

### Stone and Iron

Stone quarries and iron mines have unlimited amounts of those resources, but their harvest rate is limited by the max number of people working on a tile and the technology you have to harvest and transport it.

### Food

You can get food by having civilians farm or fish. The more food you have, the faster your population grows, by filling up a food counter—once it hits a required amount of food, the population grows by one, the food counter resets, and a civilian appears. If you don't produce enough food, and the counter runs out to 0, the lowest wage civilian is killed.

**Future**: If you overfarm a tile, its soil can become infertile for `n_refertilizationTurns`. The degradation of the soil can be reduced by technologies things like crop rotation, and the number of terms to fertilize can be reduced by technologies like advanced fertilization. 

## Trade

You can make income by selling excess resources of any type. Each player can set how much wood they would like to have in their stockpile. If you have more than that, it goes to market (mediated by your trading capacity).

If a player wants to build something, but doesn't have the resources for it, that player will buy the remainder from the civilization that can supply it for the cheapest amount of money (you can also choose to levy taxes, subsidize, or outright embargo trade against any civilization, if you wish). It is a direct and automatic cash transfer upon the construction of that building or unit. 

## Specialization

### Available specializations

Civilians can specialize in one of the following **resource-harvesting** professions:

* **Lumberjack**
* **Stone-cutter**
* **Miner**
* **Farmer**
* **Fisherman**

They can also take these **functional-professions**:

* **Warrior**: Can be controlled by the user for battle purposes
* **Scientist**: Must be stationed at an education building, like a University or Library
* **Future**
	* **Trader**: Are used to enable trade between civilizations, and travel the map to do so
	* **Artist**: Must be stationed at an arts building

### Skill level

Each civilian has a specialization, and an associated skill level with that specialization. They can have multiple skill levels for different specializations—though doing an activity increases their skill level in that specialization, and not doing it causes that skill level to deteriorate over time to 0.

When civilians are born, they are given a specialization based on what you've incentivized in society, and are initialized with an initial skill level in that specialization, which is a function of the education level of the city they're born in, the predominant activities in that city, and any modifiers based on focuses of Universities in that city.s

### Retraining

Retraining is intended to be costly. At the start of the game, it's not too bad—caps on your skill level are relatively low, so changing professions and retraining to that cap is cheap. But later in the game, it can be crippling, because of how long it takes to retrain up to the necessary skill level, and especially for highly technical specializations that require special, time intensive training at universities.

## Combat

Each combat unit has a **base strength** defined by what type of unit they are, and have either a **melee** or **ranged** mode of attack. You can directly control all warrior units.

The **effective strength** of a unit is a function of the base strength of the unit, the **skill level** of the unit, as well as **terrain bonuses** (hills increase damage dealt, forests and rainforests reduce damage taken).

The amount of damage dealt is a function of effective strength of each unit involved, and a minor randomization factor (you know, for fun).

### Militias and shelter

In case of an attack, you can call for militia. A percentage of your non-military civilians can go to a barracks and convert themselves into commandable militia for some number of turns, but they are have 0 skill level by default. With some upgrades, you can have more of those units, or a higher default skill level.

The percentage is a function of a default factor, as well as how **Warlike** your civilization is (see the Culture section below).

Other civilians, if they choose to obey, can be ordered to take shelter. They will hide in a building and will be safe from capture until that building is razed.

Their likelihood to obey is dependent on their **Fear** (see the Culture section below).

### Slavery

Civilians can be captured and enslaved by foreign forces. When enslaved, they will not be productive and must be supervised by units until `n_enslavementResistanceTurns` passes, in such case they will become normal citizens.

## Culture

Each city's culture 

### Warlike
